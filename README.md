# Statisical Analysis for Temperature Sensor Data
The field measurement of thermal comfort was conducted in experimental living room with five
or six respondents. The four-thermostat setting of air-conditioning was applied in this
measurement. Each thermostat setting was repeated four times. As a programmer, you need to
write a programme to compile the raw data and analyse the data.

## Part 1: Compiling raw data ##
The number indicates the observation data of room air temperature, relative humidity, globe
temperature, and air velocity of several sensors with ten seconds interval in experimental living
room.
