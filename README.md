# Statisical Analysis for Temperature Sensor Data
The field measurement of thermal comfort was conducted in experimental living room with five
or six respondents. The four-thermostat setting of air-conditioning was applied in this
measurement. Each thermostat setting was repeated four times. As a programmer, you need to
write a programme to compile the raw data and analyse the data.

## Part 1: Compiling raw data ##
The number indicates the observation data of room air temperature, relative humidity, globe
temperature, and air velocity of several sensors with ten seconds interval in experimental living
room.

* Data for temperature and relative humidity:
The columns are: (1) Number of sampling; (2) date; (3) time; (4) temperature of sensor; (5)
relative humidity (RH); (6) air temperature (Ta); (7) globe temperature (Tg).

* Data for air velocity:
The columns are (2) time and (3) air velocity.

## Part 2: Calculating the average, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum for all variables ##
Formatting: One decimal point for all variables except relative humidity is no decimal point. Results are printed to file##.csv.

Part 4: Calculate the mean radiant temperature (T_mrt) and operative temperature (T_op)
